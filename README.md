## Advent of  Code '23 is on!
The basic setup of this repository is as follows:
* Each puzzle gets its own folder.
* Each puzzle is split into two sub-puzzles, which are split up into their own files, except
* I won't be editing my code after submitting it, so
  1. I accidentally reused the file for Puzzle 1, so there's only one for that one, and
  2. The code may not be very readable.<br>
* Please don't use this code instead of creating your own solution to a day's problem, but you're free to compare your own solution to mine.
<br>
That's all folks!
